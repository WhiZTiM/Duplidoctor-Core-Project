# Duplidoctor-Core-Project
A duplicate file detector. This repository is to track the design docs; The goal of this project is to learn and teach;

Some 6 years ago, 2013, I wrote a piece of Software called duplichase; it took me some months, but I learned quite a lot. Looking at the codebase, again. There are **many many** things I would do differently if I were to write the Software again today.

This brings us to Duplicdoctor; Its a re-write attempt. This time with the goal of education.

Anyone who has just learned a programming language, and want to apply some problem solving technique to a real project is welcomed to join. This is a joint effort
